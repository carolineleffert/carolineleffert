## About Me

Welcome!


I'm currently a master's student at the University of Chicago working on my thesis on the intersection of ethnic identity and religion. Through my master's, I have gained experience in writing literature reviews, conducting and coding interviews and surveys, and analyzing data. I even learned how to code this website!


Prior to my master's, I worked for 4 years fighting for the rights and value of immigrants at a pro-immigration advocacy organization in Washington, DC.


During quarantine, one of my favorite activities to do is watch HGTV and try to convince my family to start a renovation business despite none of us ever having renovated anything in our lives.


Other fun things about me: I love animals of all kinds! I follow like a million zoos and naturalists on instagram (follow @blackAFinSTEM for some quality birding and herping content). I even listen to podcasts about animals. 


I love listening to podcasts! Current favorites include: [Ologies](https://www.alieward.com/ologies), [This Land](https://crooked.com/podcast-series/this-land/), [The Happiness Lab with Dr. Laurie Santos](https://www.happinesslab.fm/), and basically any podcast from NPR, but especially [Code Switch](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/), [Life Kit](https://www.npr.org/lifekit), and [Rough Translation](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510324/rough-translation).
