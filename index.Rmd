## About Me

I recently finished my master's degree at the University of Chicago. My thesis, of which I am extremely proud, was an interview-based project on the intersection of ethnic identity and religion, with a case study at a Croatian Catholic Church in Chicago. Through my master's, I have gained experience in writing literature reviews, conducting and coding interviews and surveys, and analyzing data. I even learned how to code this website using Rmarkdown and CSS!


Prior to my master's, I worked for 4 years fighting for the rights and value of immigrants in the United States at a pro-immigration advocacy organization in Washington, DC.


Because I'm a storyteller, I'm also a total podcast nerd. Current favorites include: [Ologies](https://www.alieward.com/ologies) and [The Happiness Lab with Dr. Laurie Santos](https://www.happinesslab.fm/), and basically any podcast from NPR, but especially <!--[Latino USA](https://www.latinousa.org/), [Life Kit](https://www.npr.org/lifekit), and -->[Rough Translation.](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510324/rough-translation)

<!-- This is how I chose to subvert how to insert a picture (which is ![](picture title goes here)) -->
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = TRUE, fig.cap = "If this whole research thing doesn't work out, at least I have my fallback career of dog model photographer for my dog JJ!"}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("JJ_pic.png"))

```
