## About Me
<!-- ![](insert picture title here -- also this line is commented out for now. how you comment out lines is by doing command-shift-c) -->

<br>

Welcome!


I'm currently a master's student at the University of Chicago working on my thesis on the intersection of ethnic identity and religion. Through my master's, I have gained experience in writing literature reviews, conducting and coding interviews and surveys, and analyzing data. I even learned how to code this website!


Prior to my master's, I worked for 4 years fighting for the rights and value of immigrants at a pro-immigration advocacy organization in Washington, DC.


During quarantine, one of my favorite things to do is watch HGTV and try to convince my family to start a renovation business despite none of us ever having renovated anything in our lives.
